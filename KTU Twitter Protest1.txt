Vcyude ponnu bharya pettathalla ktu
The government and the community have frozen to think on new reforms over offline exams. 
Offline exams decide the value of the university?? Nonsense. Meanwhile the university doesn't value the life of the students. 
New solutions for new problems
Exams must be conducted but not with trading of lives
Party meetings and other official meetings conducted online but exams offline? Someone bring a spanner.
KTU conducts meetings online, then why can't exams?
Go back offline exams bring back justice 
Please consider students as human beings and not as rats in a science lab 
Exams come and go but Corona takes and goes 
It's not a game it's lives that's going to matter 
Have mercy on students 
Exams are not to decide anything but offline exams will be responsible for the lives of the students and their parents in this pandemic 
Wake up political leaders the ktu students need your help
Exams are nothing but just for a grade and not for a living
Offline exams are threat to the students 
Please consider students of ktu as human beings
Where are the political parties we voted for. Speak for the students and their family. 
This business shit should stop @apjaktuofficial and bring new ammendments to the education system 
Dirty politics have gone blind and they stand with the so called iit kerala for money
Why not before and why now when there are thousands of cases reported daily
Life of students are risked for money
@apjaktuofficial has decided to conduct an experiment on their students by conducting the exams in offline mode to check whether their students are prone to the virus or not
#BreakTheChain is a comedy because the kerala technical university decides to conduct the exams in offline mode. 
Students are not Guinea pigs for your dirty political trials.
we have  elder and younger family members.we cant pull them into covid.our life should priorties than exams
We are humans, dnt play with the life of students.

യൂണിവേഴ്സിറ്റി യുടെ സേച്ഛാധിപത്യ തീരുമാനം അവസാനിപ്പിക്കുക
KTU വിദ്യാർത്ഥികൾ ഗിനിപ്പന്നികൾ അല്ല..
